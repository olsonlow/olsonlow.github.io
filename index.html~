<h1>Welcome to Sprotocols</h1><img src="afibImage.png" style="width:100px; height:100px">
<p>This iOS application was crated as a senior design project in 2014.</p>
<p>Authors:<i>Luke Vergos, Zach Dahlgren, Lowell Olson</i></p>
<p>The idea for this app came from a cardiologist in Santa Rosa CA who<br>
wanted an easier way to share patient care and diagnostic/treatment capabilities<br>
with general practicioners.  Sprotocols is the resulting attempt at this.<br>
Sprotocols allows a specialist to dynamically create medical protocols within the app<br>
and share them on the app.  Other doctors with access to the app, in user mode<br>
can then use the protocols in their patient care routines.  <br>
The app is not totally complete and requires some collaboration with doctors to<br>
 make some decisions about how the calculation funcitions should be completed.<br>
 However, it is in a state of completeness that allows it to be demonstrated.<br>
I intend to complete a short video and post it to this site soon.
